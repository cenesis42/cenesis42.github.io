  <h1>Sushi</h1>
  <div class= "section">
    A dish known as narezushi (馴れ寿司, 熟寿司, "salted fish"), stored in fermented rice for possibly months at a time, has been cited as one of the early influences for the Japanese practice of applying rice on raw fish.[6] The fish was fermented with rice vinegar, salt, and rice, after which the rice was discarded. The process can be traced back to the early domestication of rice in the Neolithic cultures of China.[citation needed] Fermentation methods following similar logic in other Asian rice cultures include prahok (ប្រហុក), pla ra (ปลาร้า), burong isda, sikhae (식해), and amazake (甘酒).[6][7]

The lacto-fermentation of the rice prevents the fish from spoiling. When wet-field rice cultivation was introduced during the Yayoi period, lakes and rivers would flood during the rainy season and fish would get caught in the rice paddy fields. Pickling was a way to preserve the excess fish and guarantee food for the next months, and narezushi became an important source of protein for Japanese consumers. The term sushi literally means "sour-tasting", as the overall dish has a sour and umami or savoury taste. The term comes from an antiquated し shi terminal-form conjugation, no longer used in other contexts, of the adjectival verb sui (酸い, "to be sour"),[8] resulting in the term sushi (酸し).[9] Narezushi still exists as a regional specialty, notably as funa-zushi from Shiga Prefecture.[10]
Osaka-style sushi, also called oshi-zushi or hako-sushi
Vinegar began to be added to the preparation of narezushi in the Muromachi period (1336–1573) for the sake of enhancing both taste and preservation. In addition to increasing the sourness of the rice, the vinegar significantly increased the dish's longevity, causing the fermentation process to be shortened and eventually abandoned. The primitive sushi would be further developed in Osaka, where over several centuries it became oshi-zushi or hako-zushi; in this preparation, the seafood and rice were pressed into shape with wooden (typically bamboo) molds.
